## 🔍 General Overview

This work, developed in Python (**.ipynb**), uses data collected from **SideSeeing** app 
(https://github.com/rafaelpezzuto/sideseeing-tools), which captures  the 
user's movement and generates a lot of **csv** files that were used to model 
**Uniform** and **Uniformly Accelerated** motions. 
Besides that, **Euler** and **Analytic** models were used to simulate those 
motions, including small random noise, and then were compared to real data.

## ⚙️ How to run
The project must be executed in google colab's enviroment.

**Note**: Check **myPath()** function to understand the management of **csv** files.
